I am taking a few guest lectures for the Computer Graphics course at <a href="https://www.iitj.ac.in/">IIT Jodhpur</a>. These lectures will be on physically based rendering with ray tracing - following our course at <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT Hyderabad</a>. Many thanks to <a href="https://3dcomputervision.github.io/about/">Prof. Avinash</a> for the invitation! <img src="/assets/img/new.gif"/>
