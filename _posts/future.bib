abstract={Efficiently and accurately rendering  hair accounting for multiple scattering is a challenging  open problem. We present a technique to infer the higher order scattering in hair in constant time within the path tracing framework, while achieving better computational efficiency. Our method makes no assumptions about the scene and provides control over the  renderer's bias & speedup.},
