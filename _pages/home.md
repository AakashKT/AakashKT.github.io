<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Ph.D candidate at IIIT-H, Aug 2020 - May 2024 (Expected)

I am a final year Ph.D candidate at CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad, supervised by <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=3HKjt_IAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. P. J. Narayanan</a> (Funded by the <a target="_blank" href="https://kcis.iiit.ac.in/fellowship">KCIS fellowship</a>).<br>
Previously, I completed my MS by research at IIIT Hyderabad, which is also where I completed my BTech in Computer Science Engineering.<br>
My research involves playing around with the light transport equation towards real-time performance, differentiable rendering and neural rendering.
<br><br>
During my Ph.D, I have had the pleasure of collaborating with <a href="https://eheitzresearch.wordpress.com/">Eric Heitz</a> & <a href="https://onrendering.com/">Jonathan Dupuy</a> during their time at <br> <a href="https://unity-grenoble.github.io/website/">Unity 
Research, Grenoble</a>. 
<br>
I have also been fortunate to have worked as a Research Scientist Intern at <a target="_blank" href="https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/">Meta Reality Labs</a> in Pittsburgh, with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gjnam">Giljoo Nam</a>.
