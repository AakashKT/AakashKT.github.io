I am a third year Ph.D candidate at CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad, supervised by <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=3HKjt_IAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. P. J. Narayanan</a> (Funded by the <a target="_blank" href="https://kcis.iiit.ac.in/fellowship">KCIS fellowship</a>).<br>
Previously, I completed my MS by research at IIIT Hyderabad, which is also where I completed my BTech in Computer Science Engineering.<br>
My research involves playing around with the light transport equation for real-time performance, differentiable rendering and neural rendering (in other words, I work on Computer Vision/Computer Graphics and Machine Learning/Deep Learning.).
